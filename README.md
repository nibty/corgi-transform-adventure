# Corgi Transform Adventure

A fun 2D side-scrolling platformer where you can transform between human and corgi forms to solve puzzles and collect treats!

This game was created using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) as an experiment to see how effectively an AI assistant could develop a complete web-based game from scratch. The entire game was built through conversational programming, demonstrating the potential of AI-assisted game development.
